    "content": "To find the volume of a cube, we need to understand that a cube has all sides of equal length. Since we know one side of the cube is 4cm, we know all sides are 4cm. The volume of a cube is found by multiplying the length, width, and height of the cube together. Since all sides of a cube are the same, we can think of it as multiplying the side length by itself three times. \n\nSo, the formula for the volume of a cube is side length * side length * side length, or side length cubed. Now, let's think about how we can use the side length of 4cm to help us find the volume. What happens when you multiply 4cm by itself?"
