Write down the given equation: a + b = 10\n2. Substitute the given value of a into the equation: 5 + b = 10\n3. Solve for b by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation\n\n### Guided Example\nGiven the equation a + b = 10 and a = 5, we substitute a into the equation:\n5 + b = 10\nSubtract 5 from both sides:\n5 + b - 5 = 10 - 5\nThis simplifies to:\nb = 5\n\n### Follow-up Question\nWhat would be the value of b if the equation was a + b = 15 and a = 5?",
