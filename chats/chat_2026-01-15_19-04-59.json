    "content": "To find the volume of a cube, you need to know that a cube has all sides of equal length. Since you know one side is 4cm, all sides are 4cm. The formula to find the volume of a cube is by multiplying the length of a side by itself three times (because a cube has three dimensions: length, width, and height, and for a cube, these are all the same). So, you multiply 4cm by 4cm, and then multiply that result by 4cm again. \n\nThink about how the volume would change if the side length of the cube changed - if the side length got bigger, what would happen to the volume?",
