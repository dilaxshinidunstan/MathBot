    "content": "To find the volume of a cube, you need to know that a cube has all sides of equal length. Since you know one side is 4cm, all sides are 4cm. The volume of a cube is found by multiplying the length, width, and height of the cube together. Since all sides of a cube are the same, you can think of it as multiplying the side length by itself three times. This can be written as side length \u00d7 side length \u00d7 side length, or in a shorter way, side length cubed. \n\nWhat happens to the volume if you multiply the side length by itself three times, using the side length of 4cm?",

The volume of a cube is found by multiplying the length, width, and height of the cube together. Since all sides of a cube are the same, we can think of it as multiplying the side length by itself three times. \n\nSo, if we have a side length, let's call it \"s\", the volume would be s * s * s, or s^3. Now, let's think about how we can use this idea to find the volume of our cube with a side length of 4cm. \n\nWhat happens when we multiply 4 by itself three times?"

Let's call this equal measurement \"s\". \n\nThe volume of a cube is like the amount of space inside it. Think of it like a box where you can store things. The more space inside the box, the more things you can store. \n\nThe volume of the cube depends on the size of \"s\". If \"s\" is bigger, the volume will be bigger too. If \"s\" is smaller, the volume will be smaller. \n\nWe use a formula to calculate the volume, which is s * s * s, or s cubed. This makes sense because we're multiplying the length, width, and height together, and since they're all equal, we're basically multiplying \"s\" by itself three times.\n\nWhat happens to the volume if we increase the size of \"s\" by a little bit?"
